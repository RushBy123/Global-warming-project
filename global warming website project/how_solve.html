            <h2>About Us & Our Mission</h2>
            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>Amber, Ruby, Amy, three ninth graders at MHS that wanted to contribute to the solution of global warming. 
            
            The solution to global warming is an accumulation of everybody’s effort!</p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>Global Warming. What’s global warming? What can global warming actually do to our lives? Is there really a possibility to solve or slow down the process of global warming? </p>
            
            <p>It was in the first semester of 9th grade that we learned about the seriousness of global warming by a documentary called An Inconvenient Truth about the US Vice President Al Gore’s speeches and campaign on climate change — global warming. We are all deeply touched and concerned. What’s so inconvenient about it? </p>
            <p>
                Previously, we knew that the sea level rises yearly due to global warming, but didn’t know that it meant the growing magnitude of the hurricanes yearly, meant the expanding area of damage and coverage fee of reconstruction around the coasts. We knew that the pole areas’ icebergs were melting, polar area organisms are losing habitats and food source, but we didn’t know the severity of polar bears’ population decline. What led to nowaday circumstances? Largely, it’s because of fossil fuel burning — generation of electricity, energy consumption of vehicles and industries — and deforestation — clearing land for agriculture; but, we, humans, did all of this because they are inevitable and useful, as mostly nonrenewable resources are the main source of production.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, the situation drove us to think and ask the questions at the beginning of this passage.

                We are questioning, realizing, and trying to contribute to the solution of global warming by figuring out a solution, of ourselves. Three ninth graders that wanted to do something to slow down the gradually exacerbating global warming. What can we do?
            </p>
            <p>
                We decided to raise the awareness of people, just as we have been raised, of MHS students and adults to know about global warming, learn about global warming, and eventually act in reality to slow down the process of global warming. In the 2022 MHS Hackathon, we took this opportunity and chose global warming as the topic of our project, and you see this website that you are scrolling through to read about global warming and us.
            </p>
            <p>
                To solve global warming, everybody’s effort is counted and rewarded, as we are all inhabitants of our planet. Every action, big or small, is indispensable, accountable and invaluable.

            <h3>
                Causes of global warming
            </h3>

                <p>
                    The sun gives off heat radiation, some of which is absorbed by the earth's surface and the rest bounces back. Gases in our atmosphere retain some heat, such as carbon dioxide. When people burn fossil fuels like oil and coal, or cut down forests and burn them, they produce a lot of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas. Although this is a good way to keep the earth warm, we produce too much greenhouse gases and heat accumulates, making the earth hotter.  Global warming will redistribute global precipitation, melt glaciers and frozen soil, and raise sea level, which will not only endanger the balance of natural ecosystems, but also affect human health and even threaten human survival.
